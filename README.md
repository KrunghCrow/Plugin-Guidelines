### Introductions
In the Plugin world allot of things can be very sus like releasing forks as a premium plugin or taking an idea and release it to public when
the plugin was made private for a certain person/server.
Not just the fact its not a nice thing to do ,servers depend on their own custom plugins or setup to be and remain unique.
### Do's and Dont's

* **Do :** Be unique or have features any existing plugin does not have added (with the consent of the original plugin dev) and mention the idea/permission from original dev/server.
* **Dont** : Fork a existing plugin do some modifications or refracturing the code with minor additions then release it under your own name.
