# Introduction
```
In the Plugin world allot of things can be very sus like releasing forks as a premium plugin.
Taking an idea/concept or existing plugin and release it to the public when the subject is denied for sharing.
When the plugin was made private or for a certain person/server.
Not just the fact its not a nice thing to do !
Servers depend on their own custom plugins or setup to be and remain unique.
